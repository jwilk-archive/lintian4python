Lintian_ dissects Debian_ packages and reports bugs and policy violations.
It contains automated checks for many aspects of `Debian policy`_
as well as some checks for common errors.

**lintian4python** was an experimental flavor of Lintian designed to
check packages implemented in Python_.

Parts of it have been revived as a distro-agnostic static code checker,
pydiatra_.
